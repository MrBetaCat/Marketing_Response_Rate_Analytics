Using OpenMP with R packages in OS X

Mainly refer the link below:

1. Install homebrew
2. Install gcc:
   brew install gcc --without-multilib
3. create (or edit) ~/.R/Makevars to include the following:

CC=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/gcc-6
CXX=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/g++-6
CXX1X = /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/g++-6
SHLIB_CXXLD=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/g++-6
FC=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/gfortran-6
F77=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/gfortran-6
MAKE=make -j8

SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS=-fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS=-fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_FCFLAGS=-fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS=-fopenmp

Make sure you adjust the version directory and the major version on the executable file names to match what homebrew installed
in the last step. 
Attention: many suggestions online didn’t include the 3rd line “CXX1X = /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.1.0/bin/g++-6”, but I find
that this line is necessary to avoid xgboost installation error in R. 

   If there is no ~/.R/Makevars
   First, create one:
   mkdir ~/.R
   touch ~/.R/Makevars; open ~/.R/Makevars
4. Install R packages from source:
Use the following command in Rstudio or R:
install.packages("xgboost", repos="http://dmlc.ml/drat/", type = "source")
